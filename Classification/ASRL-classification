# Required libraries
# Assuming you have libraries for ASRL and a classifier (e.g., randomForest)

# Initialization
N <- 100  # Population size for ASRL
Q <- matrix(0, nrow = N, ncol = N)  # Q-function for ASRL agent
alpha <- 0.1  # Initial learning rate
gamma <- 0.9  # Discount factor

# Load your data
# X <- ...  # Feature matrix of size n x d
# y <- ...  # Target labels of size n x 1

# State and Action Representation
d <- ncol(X)
state <- sample(c(0, 1), d, replace = TRUE)  # Represents a feature subset
action_space <- list()  # All possible feature subsets

# Classification using Selected Features
S_start <- numeric(0)  # Initialize selected features

# Train a classifier using the selected features S_start on the feature matrix X and target labels y
# For this example, let's assume a random forest classifier
library(randomForest)
classifier <- randomForest(X[, S_start], y)

# Classify each new instance using the trained classifier
# Assuming you have a test set X_test
predictions <- predict(classifier, newdata = X_test)

# Compute reward based on classifier performance
# This step requires a specific metric or method to compute the reward
r <- sum(predictions == y_test) / length(y_test)  # Example: accuracy as reward

# Update adaptive learning rate
alpha_0 <- 0.1  # Initial learning rate
episode <- 1  # Current episode number
alpha <- alpha_0 / sqrt(episode)

# Update Q-function
for(i in 1:length(state)) {
  for(j in 1:length(action_space)) {
    Q[state[i], action_space[j]] <- Q[state[i], action_space[j]] + alpha * (r + gamma * max(Q[state, ]) - Q[state[i], action_space[j]])
  }
}
