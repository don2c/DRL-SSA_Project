# DRL-SSA_Project
#Introduction
This GitHub repository presents a composite framework, DRL-SSA, designed to address the limitations of reducing dimensionality in raw Online Social Network (OSN) account traffic data. By integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), DRL-SSA optimizes hyperparameters and trains agents to detect malicious OSN activities. The framework utilizes Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations (BERT) approaches to effectively handle different data types, enhancing dataset suitability for subsequent analysis and modeling. 

This repository includes the source code for the paper "Intrusion Detection in Online Social Networks: Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning and Salp Swarm Algorithm"
