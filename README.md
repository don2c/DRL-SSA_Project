# ASRL: Adaptive Swarm Reinforcement Learning For Enhanced OSN Intrusion Detection

## Introduction

Online Social Networks (OSNs) are increasingly under threat from hackers, jeopardizing user privacy and security. Traditional methods, which often relied on default learning rate calibrations, have been inadequate in capturing the diverse patterns present in OSN traffic data. Deep Learning, with its capability to model intricate data patterns, presents a potential solution to this challenge.

## Background

Observations have shown recurrent patterns in user interactions within OSNs. These interactions exhibit complex fluctuations in frequencies, both within specific periods and across different periods. However, the limitations of default learning rate calibration in representation capability have often hindered the accurate detection of these patterns.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning**: Harnesses the power of deep learning to model complex patterns in data.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Extends the analysis of single uniform variations into multi-variation by analyzing diverse user interactions distinctly.
- **Recurrent Patterns**: Identifies complex fluctuations in interaction frequencies within distinct periods and across them.
- **High Accuracy**: ASRL achieved a 98.59% accuracy rate in tests, outperforming existing methods.

## Our Solution

To overcome these challenges, our research introduces the **Adaptive Swarm Reinforcement Learning (ASRL)** framework. This framework is specifically designed to detect intrusions by recognizing the diverse patterns in OSN traffic data. Instead of analyzing single uniform variations, ASRL extends the analysis into multi-variations. It does so by distinctly analyzing diverse user interactions based on adaptive learning. This approach allows for easy modularity, accommodating the various types of data generated by OSNs.

## Benefits

With the implementation of ASRL, cybersecurity in Online Social Networks can be significantly enhanced. This not only ensures the safety and privacy of user data but also instils confidence in millions of users worldwide.

## Algorithms

### Data Preprocessing using ASRL

1. Initiate the memory module conditions.
2. Data Cleaning: Remove missing, irrelevant, or duplicate data.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Use UMAP to reduce dataset size.
4. Time Series Analysis: Use LSTM to capture temporal patterns.
5. Textual Data Pre-processing: Apply BERT for text-based features.

### Feature Selection using ASRL

1. Initialization: Set population size, initialize Q-function, set learning rate and discount factor.
2. State and Action Representation: Define feature matrix, state, and action space.
3. Classification using Selected Features: Train a classifier using selected features and classify new instances.
